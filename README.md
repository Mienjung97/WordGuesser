# WordGuesser
Word Guesser is a game that bases its core functionality on the well known game "Hangman" - but this version lets you race against the fuel in your racecar:

Instead of just being punished for wrong inputs, the player will be rewarded for correct guesses by moving the racecar closer to the finish line. The "punishment" for guessed letters that are not contained in the word to guess, the player will loose one bar of fuel. 

The words to guess are all car brands, ranging from three up to 12 letters. The player starts with 6 fuel bars (tries).
